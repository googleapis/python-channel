class CloudChannelServiceGrpcAsyncIOTransport(CloudChannelServiceTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for CloudChannelService.

    CloudChannelService lets Google cloud resellers and distributors
    manage their customers, channel partners, entitlements, and reports.

    Using this service:

    1. Resellers and distributors can manage a customer entity.
    2. Distributors can register an authorized reseller in their channel
       and provide them with delegated admin access.
    3. Resellers and distributors can manage customer entitlements.

    CloudChannelService exposes the following resources:

    -  [Customer][google.cloud.channel.v1.Customer]s: An entity—usually
       an enterprise—managed by a reseller or distributor.

    -  [Entitlement][google.cloud.channel.v1.Entitlement]s: An entity
       that provides a customer with the means to use a service.
       Entitlements are created or updated as a result of a successful
       fulfillment.

    -  [ChannelPartnerLink][google.cloud.channel.v1.ChannelPartnerLink]s:
       An entity that identifies links between distributors and their
       indirect resellers in a channel.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
